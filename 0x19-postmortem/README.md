Post-Incident Analysis: The Great Web Service Outage Debacle

Incident Summary:
- Impact: 
  - Picture this: Our primary web service pulled a disappearing act, leaving 60% of our users in a state of bewilderment, like when you can't find your keys in the morning.
Chronology:
- Detection: 
  - September 12th 2023, 21:00 EAT
    - The IT Bat-signal lit up the night sky (thanks to our monitoring systems) as errors piled up and response times nosedived on our web service.
- Response Steps:
  - Meet Calvin John, our web service superhero, on-call at the moment of crisis.
  - Our crack team descended on the server infrastructure, load balancers, and application code, armed with debugging capes.
  - Our first theory: A marketing campaign unleashed a digital stampede on our servers.

- Misleading Investigations:
  - We donned our Sherlock Holmes hats to investigate DDoS attacks and even questioned the databases. Alas, elementary, my dear Watson, it wasn't them!

- Escalation:
  - The situation got so hairy that we had to summon the DevOps and Networking Avengers for backup.

- Resolution:
  - Fast forward to September 15th  2023, 7:45 EAT
  - The culprit unmasked itself: a misconfigured firewall rule. It was the silent villain blocking innocent traffic.
  - Our solution? Put that rule in rehab, and a quick reboot for our servers to get them back on track.

Root Cause and Solution:
- Root Cause:
  - The arch-nemesis here was a misconfigured firewall rule, likely sneaked in during a maintenance session, blocking the good guys (specific IP addresses).
- Resolution:
  - We set the rule straight, allowing the traffic it had wrongly denied, and voila! A reboot, and we were back in business.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
- Enhancements:
  - Our game plan includes automating firewall rule testing, a stricter peer review process, and beefed-up monitoring for rule changes.
- Action Items:
  1. Implement automated firewall rule testing in development.
  2. Set up automated regression tests for critical configurations.
  3. Give our documentation and procedures a makeover for firewall rule changes.
  4. Gather all the heroes for a post-incident pow-wow to share insights and upgrade our teamwork.

Conclusion:
The mishap involving the incorrectly configured firewall rule taught us that the true heroes of web service dependability are a well-planned change management procedure and watchful supervision.
And to really set this post-mortem apart from the tsunami of information, picture the incorrectly configured firewall rule as a "villainous bouncer," denying the good people access. Don't worry, though; when we gave him a hard talk, he let everyone in!
